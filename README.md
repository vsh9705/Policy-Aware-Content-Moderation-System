# Content Moderation System

A Django-based content moderation system with JWT authentication that checks uploaded documents against company policy documents using AI. Because manually reading every document is so 2010.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with registration, login, and logout (no carrier pigeons involved)
- **Policy Management**: Upload and manage policy PDF documents (yes, PDFs in 2025, we're rebels)
- **Content Moderation**: Check documents against policies using RAG Pipeline (fancy AI stuff)
- **Final Verdict System**: Human-in-the-loop review with approve/reject decisions (because AI isn't always right, yet)
- **File Viewing**: View original PDFs before making final decisions (radical transparency)
- **Moderation History**: Track all moderation results per user (big brother, but for documents)
- **Vector Database**: Uses Chroma for efficient policy document retrieval (it's like Google, but for your policies)
- **RESTful API**: Built with Django REST Framework
- **Modern Frontend**: React-based UI with gradients and stuff (because flat design is boring)

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django 4.2, Django REST Framework
- **Frontend**: React, duh
- **Authentication**: JWT (djangorestframework-simplejwt)
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, Groq LLM, Sentence Transformers
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB
- **PDF Processing**: PyPDF

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (not Python 2, please don't)
- pip (should come with Python, if not, good luck)
- Node.js & npm (for the React frontend)
- Groq API Key (get one at https://console.groq.com)

## Installation & Setup

### Backend Setup

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone 
cd content-moderation-system
```

#### 2. Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Activate on Windows (the hard way)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate on macOS/Linux (the cool way)
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Go grab a coffee, this might take a while
```

#### 4. Set up environment variables
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your credentials
# - SECRET_KEY: Django secret key (make it actually secret)
# - GROQ_API_KEY: Your Groq API key (don't commit this to Git)
```

#### 5. Run migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
# Watch the magic happen
```

#### 6. Create superuser (highly recommended)
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
# You'll need this to access the admin panel
```

#### 7. Run the development server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
# Backend is now alive at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

### Frontend Setup

#### 1. Navigate to frontend directory
```bash
cd frontend
```

#### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# Another coffee break
```

#### 3. Create environment file
```bash
# Create frontend/.env
echo "REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000" > .env
```

#### 4. Start the development server
```bash
npm start
# Frontend is now alive at http://localhost:3000/
```

## Usage Flow

1. **Register/Login**: Create an account or login to get JWT tokens (authentication is fun)
2. **Upload Policies**: Upload one or more policy PDF documents (these are your rules)
3. **Moderate Content**: Upload a document to check against policies (let AI do the heavy lifting)
4. **Review Results**: Check AI-generated moderation results (but don't trust it blindly)
5. **View Original File**: Click to view the actual PDF (revolutionary feature)
6. **Make Final Decision**: Approve as Clean or Reject as Violation (you're the boss)
7. **Track History**: View all past moderations and decisions (audit trail included)

## Database Models

### User Profile
- Extends Django's built-in User model
- Tracks creation and update timestamps
- Nothing fancy, just the basics

### Policy Document
- Stores uploaded policy PDFs
- Links to user who uploaded
- Tracks file metadata (size, name, etc.)

### Moderation Result
- Stores results of file moderation
- Links to user who initiated moderation
- Contains verdict and chunk statistics
- **NEW**: Includes `final_verdict` (pending/approved/rejected)
- **NEW**: Includes `reviewed_at` timestamp

### Violation Detail
- Stores specific violations found in chunks
- Links to moderation result
- Contains explanation and policy sources
- Supports VIOLATION, REVIEW, and ERROR verdicts

## Key Features Explained

### RAG Pipeline (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
The system uses a sophisticated RAG pipeline:
1. **Policy Upload**: PDFs are chunked and embedded into a vector database
2. **Similarity Search**: When moderating, relevant policy chunks are retrieved
3. **LLM Analysis**: Groq LLM analyzes content against retrieved policies
4. **Verdict Generation**: AI generates VIOLATION, REVIEW, or OK verdicts

### Human-in-the-Loop Review
Because AI isn't perfect (yet):
- AI provides initial moderation verdict
- Flags unclear cases as "REVIEW" 
- Human reviews violations and file content
- User makes final approve/reject decision
- System tracks both AI verdict and human decision

### Stats Dashboard
Get the big picture at a glance:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Clean Files**: Files with no issues
- ðŸ”´ **Violations Found**: Files flagged by AI
- ðŸŸ¡ **Needs Review**: Unclear cases requiring attention
- ðŸ”µ **Active Policies**: Number of policy documents loaded

## Admin Panel

Access the Django admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`

You can:
- View all users and their profiles
- Manage policy documents
- Review moderation results and violations
- Be an admin (feels powerful, doesn't it?)

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
python manage.py test
# Pray they all pass
```

### Creating Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
# Database evolution in action
```

### Collecting Static Files

```

## Troubleshooting

### Policy Store Issues
If you encounter issues with the policy store:
```bash
# Clear the policy store via API
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/moderation/clear-policies/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"

# Or manually nuke it
rm -rf policy_store/*
```

### Database Issues
```bash
# The nuclear option (deletes all data)
rm db.sqlite3
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### "Module not found" Errors
```bash
# Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
